GTA Online's Transform Races are crazy<br>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NbGt59KMGvw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>

GTA Online’s wacky races now include 15 new 'Transform Races' that manage to have a bit of something for everyone, from speeding through the skies in a jet to bouncing down a mountain on a bike, all in the same race. See, these races change your vehicle at set points, so one moment you might be jumping off a ramp in a supercar, but then you’re suddenly in a helicopter. 
The 15 races feature different vehicles and elaborate tracks, all of which you can check out here. If you click on the links in their names, you’ll be able to bookmark them, making it easier to access them in-game. 
Personally, Split Personality is my thing. “You’ve only got a few seconds of hurtling down Mount Chiliad on a BMX to make that age-old decision. Left or right? With the pack or on your own? Jet-powered super car or flying motorbike? Featuring BMXes, the FMJ, Rocket Voltic, Besra, Oppressor and Parachutes.”
There’s also a Smuggler’s Run sale going on, with 25% discounts on aircraft, while Lamar’s missions will net you more cash and RP to put towards big purchases.

GTA Online: take to the skies in latest Adversary Mode with the .50 caliber turret packing Mammoth Mogul<br>

GTA Online players have a new plane to catch, and it’s a doozy.
The twin-propeller Mammoth Mogul is the latest plane to be added to GTA Online.
It sports a .50 caliber turret, making it easier to take down others dogging your tail. Upgradeable features include jet-assisted takeoff and a bay for housing explosive, incendiary, gas and cluster Bombs.
The Mammoth Mogul is available exclusively from Warstock Cache & Carry.
As an incentive to upgrade your flying machine(s), discounts on engine, armor, handling, weapons and racing suits are live alongside 25% off the Hangar’s Aircraft Workshop. Mobile Operation Center Cabs, APC and the Progen T20 (Super) are all 25% off.
These discounts will come in handy as you prepare for this week’s new Adversary Mode, which is centered around aerial dogfights.
Stockpile is an airborne version of capture-the-flag and tasks players with acquiring as much “loot” as possible and bringing it back to the base. With support for two to four teams and up to sixteen players, whoever has the biggest haul wins.
Just be on the lookout for those attempting to steal your hard-earned goods. Use those spiffy machine gun and missile-equipped planes to take them down beforehand.
Players will also earn Double GTA$ & RP while Stockpile is live in GTA Onlinethrough October 9. In addition, all of Ron’s Contact Missions are handing out Double GTA$ & RP through October 9.
Also through October 9, the Premium Race “Around The Docks” will be live, and locked to motorbikes. The Time Trial is Power Station.
